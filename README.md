**Description:**

I have used the [Google charts api](https://developers.google.com/chart) to render the charts in our website. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of google charts api, css-flexbox, how to make the site responsive, how to embed other JS frameworks, use of images in the website, adding event listeners etc. The site contains a form where you can input to find the current exchange rate between two currencies and then it also shows a bar chart containing 5 rates.
